# Groovy List IndexOutOfBoundsException

This example demonstrates the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that occurs in Groovy when attempting to access an element in a list using an index that is out of bounds.  The code attempts to access the element at index 5 of a list containing only 5 elements (indices 0-4). This results in an exception being thrown.

The solution shows how to handle such situations, either by checking the index bounds or using safe navigation.
